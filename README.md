# Game of Life
## What is it?
A simple game of life, coded with vanilla JS, HTML, CSS and love.
Firstly made as an exercise, but making it better is the goal.

## For whom are the credits?
Initially forked from [ftassy49100's repository](https://github.com/ftassy49100/game_of_life).

I actually made it with him, now forking to enhance it as an exercise. It is just a reference
to know how to achieve this kind of exercice. The code is not supposed to be the best.
It is just to see some specific things on how to do things with JS.

## How to run?
Simply open the index.html file in your browser. You're done here!

## TODO
- [ ] Inaccurate naming on X and Y. Actually, X is for a row instead of a column, and vice-versa for Y.
- [ ] Make it with functional-programming with dedicated API linking DOM to state (e.g.: object containing neighbors with top, topRight, ...)
